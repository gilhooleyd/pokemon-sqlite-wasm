# SQLite in Web-Assembly with Pokemon

This demo uses SQLite in the browser and generates a table of pokemon data.
There are no web framework dependencies, so this is technically a static
site.

This project was based off of:
[vkbansal/sqlite-wasm-demo](https://github.com/vkbansal/sqlite-wasm-demo)

## Running locally
